      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        I'm a self-taught creative professional with a deep passion for design and over 5 years of experience in corporate marketing. Currently working as a Digital Designer at Starbright, I specialise in Website and UI Design, creating user-friendly experiences that drive results. My expertise spans across Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and modern design tools, allowing me to deliver comprehensive design solutions from concept to completion.

        When I'm not designing, you'll find me carp fishing by the water or immersed in hardcore survival games and first-person shooters. I'm passionate about gaming and enjoy exploring challenging and immersive gaming experiences.
